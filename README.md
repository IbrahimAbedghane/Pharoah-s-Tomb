# Pharoah's Tomb

## Introduction
Pharoah's Tomb is an engaging web-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The game is inspired by the ever loved childhood classic of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Our Pharoah's Tomb extends the game play features to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock to increase the excitement and the challenge. The game is set in the dark and treacherous Ancient Egyptian tombs of the Pharoah's offering the user the unique experience of travelling back in time.
