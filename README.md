# Pharoah's Tomb

## Introduction
Pharoah's Tomb is an engaging web-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The game is inspired by the ever loved childhood classic of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Our Pharoah's Tomb extends the game play features to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock to increase the excitement and the challenge. The game is set in the dark and treacherous Ancient Egyptian tombs of the Pharoah's offering the user the unique experience of travelling back in time.

### Features Left To Implement
- The next version of the game will include a multiplayer game play mode to allow users to experience the game with their friends.

## Testing
- In order to carry out testing I have ensured that all the links works and the correct file paths are connected accordingly.
- I have ensured that each button and feature on the site works as intended and is intuitive. To aid in this testing I have deployed the game on various sized screens and devices in order to test functionality across the board.

- HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fibrahimabedghane.github.io%2FPharoah-s-Tomb%2F)
- CSS: No errors were returned when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fibrahimabedghane.github.io%2FPharoah-s-Tomb%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
- JavaScript: No errors were found when reviewed by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

### Unfixed bugs
- Although no bugs are found in the game there are short comings with the design and execution of the game and its features. The user experience would be significantly more enhanced with an increasing array of graphics/images and dynamic features to interact with on the site.
- More improvements could be made to the game play and to allow the option for the user to increase the difficulty level of the game
